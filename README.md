# Calculating and Graphically Analysing the Time Complexities of 4 Sorting Algorithms using Python

This **Python** program was written in **Jupyter Notebook**.

It includes the following sorting algorithms.

- Quick Sort.
- Merge Sort.
- Heap Sort.
- Insertion Sort.

For each of the algos, it **prompts the user 5 times to enter the value of the input size** (_Number of values to be sorted_) and for each, it will display the time taken to sort them.

For the graph, it uses the library `matpliotlib`. You have to manually enter the times taken for all of the algos in the graphing code, for now.

## This is the 1st Graph - contains all 4 sorting algos

### Second graph without Insertion Sort - clearly shows the trend of the other 3
